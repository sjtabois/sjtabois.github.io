  <h4>
    The North Wall of Grand Cayman is a world class spectacular sheer drop off boasting fabulous sponge and coral life as a backdrop to the other reef residents. Commonly spotted in the deep cobalt blue waters are eagle rays flying in fighter jet formation of up to seven animals. This is also the most likely location to spot a shark and is home to a myriad of other critters including turtles, lobster, eels, octopus and a vast variety of fish from tiny to huge! Stare into the abyss below as you hover along the side of the wall – you feel as though you are flying! As you roll over and gaze upwards you will see the abundant reef fish backlit by sunshine and silhouetted at the top of the precipice awaiting your return to the shallows. Once you move up to the top of the wall to complete your multi-level profile make sure to check under ledges and coral heads for hiding animals – you never know what you might find. As you hover at your safety stop remember to keep looking down as the parade of wildlife will continue to entertain you as you wait to return to gravity!
